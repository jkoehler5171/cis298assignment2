## Description

Create a temperature converter application.
The application should look like the screen shots I have provided.
The application should do the calculation and display the formula that was used to do the calculation.
The calculation of the conversion should take place in a separate class
The application should handle errors gracefully.
The application should have a different layout for landscape form that looks like the one pictured here.
The application must retain it's information on the screen when rotated to landscape.

Solution Requirements:

* Separate class for calculation
* Handle errors gracefully
* Display Formula and Answer
* Separate Layout for landscape
* Retain information across rotation

## Known Problems, Issues, And/Or Errors in the Program
I can't get the saved instance state stuff... back out. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong as the structure I'm using is the same as the inclass we used with it. I'm sure
it's something fairly simple that I just can't see, but I just can't get it to work.
